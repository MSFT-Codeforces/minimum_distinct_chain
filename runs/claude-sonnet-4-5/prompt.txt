You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in C++. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable C++ program in a cpp codeblock.

**Minimum Distinct Chain**

You are given a row of $n+1$ lanterns, numbered from $1$ to $n+1$. Between lantern $i$ and $i+1$ there is a character $s_i$:

- if $s_i = \texttt{<}$ then the brightness must satisfy $a_i < a_{i+1}$,
- if $s_i = \texttt{>}$ then the brightness must satisfy $a_i > a_{i+1}$.

You must assign an integer brightness array $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{n+1}$ such that:

- $1 \le a_i \le K$ for all $i$,
- all adjacent comparisons follow the string $s$.

Such an array is called **valid**.

Define the **cost** of an array as the number of **distinct** values among $a_1,\dots,a_{n+1}$. Let $c_{\min}$ be the minimum possible cost over all valid arrays (if no valid array exists, ignore $c_{\min}$).

For each test case, output the number of valid arrays whose cost equals $c_{\min}$, modulo $10^9+7$. If no valid array exists, output $0$.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of:
- one line containing two integers $n$ and $K$,
- one line containing a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only of characters `"<"` and `">"`.

**Output Format:-**

For each test case, print one integer — the number of valid arrays with minimum possible cost, modulo $10^9+7$.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le t \le 40$
- $1 \le n \le 250$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$
- $K < 10^9+7$
- $|s| = n$, and $s_i \in \{\texttt{<},\texttt{>}\}$
